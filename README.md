# Rotating Machinery Fault Detection with Machine Learning

### Overview

Rotating machines are critical in industrial settings, and failures can lead to costly damage and safety risks. This repository contains MATLAB scripts to predict faults (e.g., misalignment, imbalance, and bearing failures) using machine learning models. The goal is to develop a low-cost, efficient system that maintains high accuracy while reducing computational costs.
